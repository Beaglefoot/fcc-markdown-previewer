### It's the first project in series of React Projects on [freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com/).

The goal is to build a Markdown Previewer fulfilling the following user stories:
1. I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
1. I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

You are allowed to use any library or API you need. I mainly used:
* React
* Webpack
* Babel
* [marked](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked)
* Bootstrap

along with others included in a [boilerplate](https://github.com/Beaglefoot/fcc-react-boilerplate) which was prepared for this series previously.
